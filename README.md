# ✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction  

This machine learning project predicts airline customer satisfaction based on various factors like flight experience, service quality, and passenger feedback. Using Python and key ML libraries, the model classifies customers as **Satisfied** or **Dissatisfied**, helping airlines improve their services.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost** – Machine learning models  
- **Streamlit (Optional)** – Interactive dashboard  

##  Key Features  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training, evaluation, and optimization  
- Insights into factors influencing satisfaction  

##  Results  
- Identifies key factors affecting customer experience  
- Achieves high accuracy using optimized ML models  
- Provides actionable insights for airline service improvements.
