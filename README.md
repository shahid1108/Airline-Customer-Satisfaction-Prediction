# ✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction  

This machine learning project predicts airline customer satisfaction based on various factors like flight experience, service quality, and passenger feedback. Using Python and key ML libraries, the model classifies customers as **Satisfied** or **Dissatisfied**, helping airlines improve their services.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Pandas, Numpy** – Data processing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  

##  Key Features  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training, evaluation, and optimization  
- Insights into factors influencing satisfaction  
- Create a bar chart for Customers who are satisfied or not
- Dropped the bull values
- Dropeeds a column which is unuseful.
- Splited the data into testing and training
- Applied StandardScaler for  Scaling the data.
- Applied LabelEncoding to convert the DataType
##  Results  
- Identifies key factors affecting customer experience  
- Achieves high accuracy using optimized ML models  
- Provides actionable insights for airline service improvements.
